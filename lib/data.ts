description: `Hello! My name is Mostafa Lotfy, an indie app maker. I used to track my workouts manually or through apps that offered basic history.
\nI like to start slowl and gradually build up my progress, reviewing each workout to see how many reps or how much weight I used previously.
\nSo, I created OneExercise, a minimal workout tracker that provides instant feedback for each set while also giving quick access to the full history and some additional simple stats. This way, I can aim to improve one of these stats with each workout.
\nIn this quick guide, I will show you how to use OneExercise to easily track your workouts.`,
