## Navigate

### `ls{:bash}`

list all files and folders inside your current working directory. The current working directory is the folder where your terminal is open.

```bash title="shell" caption="Include hidden files in the list"
ls -a
```

### `cd{:bash}`

```bash title="bash" caption="Navigate to a folder inside the current directory"
cd folderName   # Change the current directory to a folder inside it. 
```

Example: `cd documents{:bash}` changes the directory from `~{:plaintext}` to `Documents{:plaintext}`.

```bash title="shell" caption="move up one directory"
cd ..
```

Example: `cd ..` changes the directory from `~/Documents` to `~/`.

```bash title="bash" caption="Navigate to the home directory"
 $ cd ~    # The `~` sign is a shortcut to `/Users/yourUserName/`
```

```bash title="bash"
 $ cd ~/Documents    # Make any folder your current working directory by writing its path from the root `/` directory or from the home `~` directory.  
```
This command will make `Documents{:plaintext}` the current working directory.

```bash title="bash"
 $ cd /    # Make the root folder the current directory.
```

### `pwd{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
pwd   # Print Working Directory. 
```
Know which directory your terminal is open at. Get a path from the root `/{:plaintext}` folder down to your current working directory.

### `clear{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
clear    # Clears the terminal screen.
```

## Command Structure

### `command -options arguments{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
ls -a Documents   # `ls` is the command, `-a` is an option, and `Documents` is the argument.
```



## Edit

### `cat{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
cat file.txt   # Read a text file inside the terminal.
```

### `open{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
open file.txt   # Open a file or folder inside the current directory. 
```
You can edit the file, save it, then get back to the terminal. Also, opens Folders in `Finder{:plaintext}` and any type of file. When opening a file, the extension must be added after the name.

```bash title="bash"
open file.pdf   # Open any type of file. Add the extension to the end of the name.
```

```bash title="bash"
open folder   # Can open folders in `Finder`. 
```
Example: `open ~/documents{:bash}` opens the documents folder in `Finder{:plaintext}`.

### `touch{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
touch newFile.txt   # Create a new empty text file inside the current directory.
```

```bash title="bash"
touch ~/desktop/newFile.txt   # Create a new empty text file inside any directory by adding a path. 
```
This command will create a new text file named `newFile.txt{:plaintext}` on the Desktop folder.

### `nano{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
nano fileName   # Create, read, or edit a text file inside the terminal. 
```
`ctrl+x{:plaintext}` to exit, `Y{:plaintext}` to save changes, then confirm the name of the file.

```bash title="bash"
nano ~/desktop/fileName   # Create or edit a text file directly on the `Desktop` without changing the current working directory to Desktop first.
```

### `echo{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
echo "line to add" >> <fileName>   # Add a line of text to a file on the fly (without opening the file)
```

```bash title="bash"
echo "alias ..='cd ..'" >> ~/.zshrc   # Add an alias directly without the need to open or navigate.
```
## Organize

### `mkdir{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
mkdir newFolder # Create a new folder in the current working directory. Stands for make directory.
```

```bash title="bash"
mkdir ~/Documents/newFolder   # Create a new folder inside `Documents` without changing the current working directory to `Documents`.
```

### `rm-r{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
rm -r folderName    # Delete files or folders without asking for confirmation!
```
### `mv{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
mv Source Destination   # Move a file or folder from source to destination.
```

```bash title="bash"
mv ~/Documents/folder1 ~/Desktop/folder1    # Cut and paste between two different directories. Move the folder `folder1` from Docouments to Desktop.
```

```bash title="bash"
mv folder1 ~/Desktop/folder1    # Cut and paste from the current working directory. Move the folder `folder1` from the current working directory to the Desktop.
```

```bash title="bash"
mv fileName.jpeg newFileName.jpeg    # Rename in the same folder.
```
```bash title="bash"
mv oldName ~/Documents/newName    # Move and rename, from the current directory to Documents.
```

```bash title="bash"
mv ~/Documents/oldName ~/Documents/newName    # Rename files and folders in any directory. Rename a folder in Documents.
```

### `cp{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
cp Source Destination # Copy a file or folder, from a source to a destination.
```

```bash title="bash"
cp file.txt folder # Copy a file into a folder. Both are inside the current directory.
```

```bash title="bash"
cp file.txt file2.txt   # Duplicate file.txt inside the current directory and name the duplicate `file2.txt`.
```

```bash title="bash"
cp ~/Desktop/file2.txt ~/Documents/file2.txt   # Copy a file from a directory to another without changing the current directory. file2.txt will be copied from Desktop to Documents.
```

```bash title="bash"
 $ cp -R folder1 ~/Documents/folder1   # Copy folders, by adding the `-R` option to the `cp` command. The `cp` command works on files by default. To make it work on folders, add the `-R` option.
```

### `du{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
du -sh    # Get the total size of the current directory.
```

```bash title="bash"
du -sh ~/Documents    # Get the total size of any directory writing its address.
```

```bash title="bash"
du -sh *    # Get the size of each file and folder in the current directory.
```

```bash title="bash"
du -sh ~/documents/*    # Get the size of each file and folder in any direcotry.
```

## Be More Efficient

### Wildcards

```bash title="bash"
cd  ~/Doc*    # Use wildcards to be lazy and avoid writing long names. This command will change the current directory to the `Documents` folder. Could also just press tab for autocompletion.
```

```bash title="bash"
ls *.pdf    # Use wildcards creatively with other commands to do more. This command will only list pdf files inside our current directory.
```

### Aliases

```bash title="bash"
alias name='command'    # Shortcuts to write a shorter version to a command.
```

```bash title="bash"
alias ..='cd ..'    # Make an alias `..` as a shortcut to `cd ..`
```

To make an alias permenant add it to one of those text files:
`~/.bash_profile{:plaintext}` 
`~/.zshrc{:plaintext}` 

### Tabs

`cmd + T{:plaintext}` To open a new tab.

`cmd + 2{:plaintext}` Cmd and the tab number, to switch between tabs.



### A minimal look

```plaintext title="text"
 ps1='$ '    # Remove everything before the `$` sign by adding this line to the `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile` files.
```


### Dealing with spaces

```bash title="bash"
touch 'new file.txt'    # Wrap the name of a file or folder in '' if they have spaces in their names.
```

### `man{:bash}`

```bash title="bash"
man du    # Use the `man` command on any command to open the manual and read more about how it works.
```

### `alt + click{:plaintext}`

`alt + click{:plaintext}`  To specify where to write instead of using the keyboard arrows.




Remember not to try to memorize commands it will happen automatically. You can refer to the command line cheat sheet when you get stuck.
