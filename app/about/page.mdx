   I am an indie app developer exploring and building tools for productivity.

    ## Projects I'm Working On
    
    ### [OneExercise](/oneexercise)

    I built OneExercise to track my workouts in a way I like. I focus on one exercise at a time, starting small and gradually building my progress. Each time I train, I aim to improve one or two simple metrics, such as repetitions, weight, or maximum weight. I want quick access to my full workout history for each specific exercise. This is how I designed and coded OneExercise; it provides immediate color-coded feedback for each set and statistic. I'm still polishing the user experience, and I have many exciting features planned!

    ### [mstflotfy.com](/)

    I am constantly making improvements to [my personal website: mstflotfy.com](/), where I publish some of the [dev & design lessons](/theindiedev) I learn while building my own apps. I also showcase the apps I create on this website. And I share some of lessons I come across while I explore productivity/self-management/self-mastery/self-help.

    ### Self-Mastery

    I am focused on improving my performance by crafting my habits. I find tracking to be a great tool, and I use various methods including apps and manual tracking for different things. I work on building mindset systems that help me improve my output, and I also develop tools to automate some of these systems.
